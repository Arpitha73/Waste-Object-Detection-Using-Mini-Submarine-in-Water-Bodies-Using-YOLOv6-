# Waste-Object-Detection-Using-Mini-Submarine-in-Water-Bodies-Using-YOLOv6

# 🛥️ 

This project aims to detect waste objects in underwater environments using a mini submarine equipped with a camera. We use the powerful YOLOv6 object detection model to identify plastic bottles, cans, and other trash submerged in lakes, ponds, or oceans.

## 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a system that:
- Deploys a mini submarine in water bodies.
- Uses a camera to capture underwater images/video.
- Runs YOLOv6 to detect and locate waste materials.
- Helps in underwater environmental monitoring and cleaning.
